# Algorithms Practice
I made Algorithms Practice during the spring of 2020.

My goal was to see and compare some of the most well-known sorting algorithms in practice.

# Highlights
* Implemented an algorithm that generates a list of random numbers.
* Implemented the Bubble Sort, the Heap Sort, the Insertion Sort, the Merge Sort, the Quick Sort, and the Selection Sort algorithms.

# Technologies Used
* Java

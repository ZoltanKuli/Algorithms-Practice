# The Story Behind Algorithms Practice

During the spring of 2020, I created Algorithms Practice because I was curious to see and compare some of the most well-known sorting algorithms in practice.

I didn't do a perfect job when implementing them. For example, I could have used generics and streams. And back then, I didn't know how important it is to think about our data structures before implementing an algorithm of any kind.

But considering everything, this was still an interesting project, and it improved my skills and knowledge.
